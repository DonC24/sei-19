The game can be played from the web browser. 

It is the base for a turn based RPG (inspired by JRPGs) that is yet to be expanded upon.
Currently there are only rooms and a basic attack system. I'd like to include items, and weapons. Friends that I have shown this game to 
think that I need to make it a dating simulator.

My unsolved problems is coding other types of quests, rather than just killing a monster.

I used object arrays for the rooms, monsters, and quests.
